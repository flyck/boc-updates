    "content": "<p>In the past, when submitting an encoding job to an <a href=\"/mediaconvert/\">AWS Elemental MediaConvert</a> reserved queue, the job would stay in that queue until it could be processed. If the queue was busy, the job would wait to start until previous jobs completed. This presents a challenge for videos requiring strict turnaround times. To solve this, MediaConvert now has the ability to submit jobs using a feature called queue hopping. You specify the queue a job should start in and how long it should wait before hopping to a different queue. With queue hopping, you can avoid long wait times for transcoding jobs that are time-sensitive while also effectively utilizing your reserved transcoding slots. For example, a job can be submitted to a reserved queue with a wait time of 15 minutes; if the job has not started after that time, it can hop to an on-demand queue to start encoding. For more information about queue hopping, please read the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/setting-up-queue-hopping-to-avoid-long-waits.html\">documentation</a>.</p>",

Instead of the default “#” to signal the end of DTMF collection, you can now specify a different digit such as “*” or a series of digits such as “##” or “0000”. For example, this can be used to let your callers enter multiple inputs such as <i>account number</i>, <i>amount</i>, and <i>stock name</i> in a single stream of digits, rather than enter each input one at a time.&nbsp;</p>",
