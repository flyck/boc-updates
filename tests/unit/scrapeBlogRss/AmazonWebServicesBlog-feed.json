    "content:encoded": "<p>It has only been five years since Jeff wrote on this blog about the launch of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-container-service-ready-for-production-use/\">Amazon Elastic Container Service</a>. I remember reading that post and thinking how exotic and unusual containers sounded. Fast forward just five years, and containers are an everyday part of most developers lives, but whilst customers are increasingly adopting container orchestrators such as <span title=\"\">ECS</span>, there are still some types of applications that have been hard to move into this containerized world.</p> \n<p>Customers building applications that require data persistence or shared storage have faced a challenge since containers are temporary in nature. As containers are scaled in and out dynamically, any local data is lost as containers are terminated. Today we are changing that for <span title=\"\">ECS</span> by launching support for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/efs\" title=\"\">Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)</a> file systems. Both containers running on <span title=\"\">ECS</span> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\" title=\"AWS Fargate\">AWS Fargate</a> will be able to use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/efs\" title=\"\">Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)</a>.</p> \n<p>This new capability will help customers containerize applications that require shared storage such as content management systems, internal DevOps tools, and machine learning frameworks. A whole new set of workloads will now enjoy the benefits containers bring, enabling customers to speed up their deployment process, optimize their infrastructure utilization, and build more resilient systems.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/efs\" title=\"\">Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)</a> provides a fully managed, highly available, scalable shared file system; it means that you can store your data separately from your compute. It is also a regional service, meaning that the service is storing data within and across 3 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/#Availability_Zones\">Availability Zones</a> for high availability and durability.</p> \n<p>Until now, it was possible to get EFS working with <span title=\"\">ECS</span> if you were running your containers on a cluster of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\" title=\"\">EC2</a> instances. However, if you wanted to use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\" title=\"AWS Fargate\">AWS Fargate</a> as your container data plane then, prior to this announcement, you couldn’t mount an EFS file system. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\" title=\"\">Fargate</a> does not allow you as a customer to gain access to the managed instances inside the Fargate fleet and so you are unable to make the modifications required to the instances to setup EFS.</p> \n<p>I’m sure many of our customers will be delighted that they now have a way of connecting EFS file systems easily to <span title=\"\">ECS</span>, personally I’m ecstatic that we can use this new feature in combination with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\" title=\"\">Fargate</a>, it will be perfect for a little side project that I am currently building and finally give us a way of having persistent storage work in combination with serverless containers.</p> \n<p>There is a good reason both ECS and EFS include the word Elastic in their name as both of these services can scale up and down as your application requires. EFS scales on demand from zero to petabytes with no disruptions, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files. With ECS there are options to use either Cluster Auto Scaling or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\" title=\"\">Fargate</a> to ensure that your capacity grows and shrinks to meet demand. For you, our customer, this means that you are only ever paying for the storage and compute that you are actually going to use.</p> \n<p>So, enough talking, let’s get to the fun bit and see how we can get a containerized application working with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/efs\" title=\"\">Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)</a>.</p> \n<p><strong><u>A Simple Shared File System Example<br /> </u></strong>For this example, I have built some basic infrastructure, so I can show you the before and after effect of adding EFS to a Fargate cluster. Firstly I have created a VPC that spans two Availability Zones. Secondly, I have created an ECS cluster. On the ECS Cluster, I plan to run two containers using Fargate, and this means that I don’t have to set up any EC2 instances as my containers will run on the Fargate fleet that is managed by AWS.</p> \n<p>To deploy my application, I create a Task Definition that uses a Docker Image of an Open Source application called <a href=\"https://github.com/coderaiser/cloudcmd\">Cloud Commander</a>, which is a simple drag and drop, file manager.</p> \n<p>In the ECS console, I create a service and use the Task Definition that I created to deploy my application. Once the service is deployed, and the containers are provisioned, I head over to the Application Load Balancer URL which was created as part of my service, and I can see that my application appears to be working. I can drag a file to upload it to the application.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36583\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/04/07/0.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"464\" /></p> \n<p>However there is a problem. If I refresh the page, occasionally, the file that I dragged to upload disappears. This happens because I have two containers running my application, and they are both using their local file systems. As I refresh my browser, the load balancer sends me to one of the two containers, and only one of the containers is storing the image on its local volume.</p> \n<p>What I need is a shared file system that both the containers can mount and to which they can both write files.</p> \n<p>Next, I create a new file system inside the EFS console. In the wizard, I choose the same VPC that I used when I created my ECS cluster and select all of the availability zones that the VPC spans and ask the service to create mount targets in each one. These mount targets will mean that containers that are in different Availability Zones will still be able to connect to the file system.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-36581\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/04/07/1-1024x542.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"542\" /></p> \n<p>I select the defaults for all the other options in the wizard. In Step 3, I click the button to <strong>Add an access Point</strong>. An access point is a way of me giving a particular application access to&nbsp;the file system and gives me incredibly granular control over what data my application is allowed to access. You can add multiple Access points to your EFS file system and provide different applications, different levels of access to the same file system.</p> \n<p>The application I am deploying will handle user uploads for my web site, so I will create an EFS Access Point that gives this application full access to the <strong>/uploads</strong> directory, but nothing else. To do this, I will create an access point with a new User ID (1000) and Group ID (1000), and a home directory of <strong>/uploads</strong>. The directory will be created with this user and group as the owner with full permissions, giving read permissions to all other users.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-36630\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/04/08/accesspoint2-1024x442.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"442\" /></p> \n<p>Security is the number one priority at AWS and the team have worked hard to ensure <span title=\"\">ECS</span> integrates with EFS to provide multiple layers of security for protecting EFS filesystems from unauthorized access, including IAM role-based access control, VPC security groups, and encryption of data in transit.</p> \n<p>After working through the wizard, my file system is created, and I’m given a File system ID and an Access point ID. I will need these IDs to configure the task definitions in Fargate.</p> \n<p>I go back to the Task Definition inside my ECS Cluster and create a new revision of the Task Definition. I scroll down to the&nbsp;Volumes&nbsp;section of the definition and click&nbsp;<strong>Add volume</strong>.</p> \n<p>I can then add my EFS File System details, I select the correct <strong>File system ID</strong> and also the correct <strong>Access point ID</strong> that I created earlier.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36596\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/04/08/3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"811\" height=\"702\" /></p> \n<p>I have opted to Enable <strong>Encryption in transit</strong>, but for this example I have not enabled <strong>EFS IAM authorization </strong>which would be helpful in a larger application with many clients requiring different levels of access for different portions of a filesystem. This&nbsp;feature can simplify management by using IAM authorization, if you want more details on this <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-amazon-efs-iam-authorization-and-access-points/\">check out the blog we wrote</a> when the feature launched earlier in the year.</p> \n<p>Now that I have updated my task definition, I can update my ECS service to use this new definition. It’s also essential here to make sure that I set the platform version to 1.4.0.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-36585\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/04/08/4-1024x594.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"594\" /></p> \n<p>The service deploys my two new containers and decommissions the old two. The new containers will now be using the shared EFS file system, and so my application now works as expected.</p> \n<p>If I upload files and then revisit the application, my files will still be there. If my containers are replaced or are scaled up or down, the file system will persist.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36632\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/04/08/5ver2-1024x648.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"506\" /></p> \n<p><strong><u>Looking to the Future</u></strong><br /> I am loving the innovation that has been coming out of the containers teams recently, and looking at their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap\">public roadmap</a>; they have some really exciting plans for the future. If you have ideas or feature requests, make sure you add your voice to the many customers that are already guiding their roadmap.</p> \n<p>The new feature is available in all regions where <span title=\"\">ECS</span> and EFS are available and comes at no additional cost. So, go check it out in the AWS console and let us know what you think.</p> \n<p>Happy Containerizing</p> \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/thebeebs\" title=\"Martin on Twitter\">— Martin</a> \n<p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?a=hjCNPaKz364:U0yF4cx1zwg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?a=hjCNPaKz364:U0yF4cx1zwg:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?a=hjCNPaKz364:U0yF4cx1zwg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AmazonWebServicesBlog/~4/hjCNPaKz364\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

    "content:encoded": "<p>Inspecting multiple log groups and log streams can make it more difficult and time consuming to analyze and diagnose the impact of an issue in real time. What customers are affected? How badly? Are some affected more than others, or are outliers? Perhaps you performed deployment of an update using a staged rollout strategy and now want to know if any customers have hit issues or if everything is behaving as expected for the target customers before continuing further. All of the data points to help answer these questions is potentially buried in a mass of logs which engineers query to get ad-hoc measurements, or build and maintain custom dashboards to help track.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/\" title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights</a>, generally available today, is a new feature to help simplify analysis of Top-N contributors to time-series data in <span title=\"\">CloudWatch Logs</span> that can help you more quickly understand who or what is impacting system and application performance, in real-time, at scale. This saves you time during an operational problem by helping you understand what is contributing to the operational issue and who or what is most affected. <span title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights</span> can also help with ongoing analysis for system and business optimization by easily surfacing outliers, performance bottlenecks, top customers, or top utilized resources, all at a glance. In addition to logs, <span title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights</span> can also be used with other products in the <span title=\"\">CloudWatch</span> portfolio, including Metrics and Alarms.</p> \n<p><span title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights</span> can analyze structured logs in either JSON or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format\">Common Log Format (CLF)</a>. Log data can be sourced from <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\" title=\"\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a> instances, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/\" title=\"\">AWS CloudTrail</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/route53/\" title=\"\">Amazon Route 53</a>, Apache Access and Error Logs, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/\" title=\"\">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (VPC) Flow Logs, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" title=\"\">AWS Lambda</a> Logs, and <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/apigateway\" title=\"\">Amazon API Gateway</a> Logs. You also have the choice of using structured logs published directly to <span title=\"\">CloudWatch</span>, or using the <span title=\"\">CloudWatch</span> Agent. <span title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights</span> will evaluate these log events in real-time and display reports that show the top contributors and number of unique contributors in a dataset. A contributor is an aggregate metric based on dimensions contained as log fields in <span title=\"\">CloudWatch Logs</span>, for example account-id, or interface-id in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/\" title=\"\">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> Flow Logs, or any other custom set of dimensions. You can sort and filter contributor data based on your own custom criteria. Report data from <span title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights</span> can be displayed on <span title=\"\">CloudWatch</span> dashboards, graphed alongside <span title=\"\">CloudWatch</span> metrics, and added to <span title=\"\">CloudWatch</span> alarms. For example customers can graph values from two <span title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights</span> reports into a single metric describing the percentage of customers impacted by faults, and configure alarms to alert when this percentage breaches pre-defined thresholds.</p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Getting Started with <span title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights</span></span><br /> </strong>To use <span title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights</span> I simply need to define one or more rules. A rule is simply a snippet of data that defines what contextual data to extract for metrics reported from <span title=\"\">CloudWatch Logs</span>. To configure a rule to identify the top contributors for a specific metric I supply three items of data – the log group (or groups), the dimensions for which the top contributors are evaluated, and filters to narrow down those top contributors. To do this, I head to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/\" title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch</a> console dashboard and select <strong>Contributor Insights</strong> from the left-hand navigation links. This takes me to the <span title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights</span> home where I can click <strong>Create a rule to get started.</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33386 aligncenter\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/11/21/contributor_insights_start.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"400\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/30/contributor_insights_createrule.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-36404 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/30/contributor_insights_createrule.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"895\" height=\"554\" /></a>To get started quickly, I can select from a library of sample rules for various services that send logs to <span title=\"\">CloudWatch Logs</span>. You can see above that there are currently a variety of sample rules for <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/apigateway\" title=\"\">Amazon API Gateway</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/route53/\" title=\"\">Amazon Route 53</a> Query Logs, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/\" title=\"\">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> Flow Logs, and logs for container services. Alternatively, I can define my own rules, as I’ll do in the rest of this post.</p> \n<p>Let’s say I have a deployed application that is publishing structured log data in JSON format directly to <span title=\"\">CloudWatch Logs</span>. This application has two API versions, one that has been used for some time and is considered stable, and a second that I have just started to roll out to my customers. I want to know as early as possible if anyone who has received the new version, targeting the new api, is receiving any faults and how many faults are being triggered. My stable api version is sending log data to one log group and my new version is using a different group, so I need to monitor multiple log groups (since I also want to know if anyone is experiencing any error, regardless of version).</p> \n<p>The JSON to define my rule, to report on 500 errors coming from any of my APIs, and to use account ID, HTTP method, and resource path as dimensions, is shown below.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n  &quot;Schema&quot;: {\n    &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;CloudWatchLogRule&quot;,\n    &quot;Version&quot;: 1\n  },\n  &quot;AggregateOn&quot;: &quot;Count&quot;,\n  &quot;Contribution&quot;: {\n    &quot;Filters&quot;: [\n      {\n        &quot;Match&quot;: &quot;$.status&quot;,\n        &quot;EqualTo&quot;: 500\n      }\n    ],\n    &quot;Keys&quot;: [\n      &quot;$.accountId&quot;,\n      &quot;$.httpMethod&quot;,\n      &quot;$.resourcePath&quot;\n    ]\n  },\n  &quot;LogFormat&quot;: &quot;JSON&quot;,\n  &quot;LogGroupNames&quot;: [\n    &quot;MyApplicationLogsV*&quot;\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>I can set up my rule using either the <strong>Wizard</strong> tab, or I can paste the JSON above into the <strong>Rule body</strong> field on the <strong>Syntax</strong> tab. Even though I have the JSON above, I’ll show using the <strong>Wizard</strong> tab in this post and you can see the completed fields below. When selecting log groups I can either select them from the drop down, if they already exist, or I can use wildcard syntax in the <strong>Select by prefix match</strong> option (<strong>MyApplicationLogsV*</strong> for example).</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/30/contributor_insights_newrule-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-36410 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/30/contributor_insights_newrule-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"794\" height=\"1185\" /></a>Clicking <strong>Create</strong> saves the new rule and makes it immediately start processing and analyzing data (unless I elect to create it in disabled state of course). Note that <span title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights</span> processes new log data created once the rule is active, it does not perform historical inspection, so I need to build rules for operational scenarios that I anticipate happening in future.</p> \n<p>With the rule in place I need to start generating some log data! To do that I’m going to use a script, written using the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/\">AWS Tools for PowerShell</a>, to simulate my deployed application being invoked by a set of customers. Of those customers, a select few (let’s call them the unfortunate ones) will be directed to the new API version which will randomly fail on HTTP POST requests. Customers using the old API version will always succeed. The script, which runs for 5000 iterations, is shown below. The cmdlets being used to work with <span title=\"\">CloudWatch Logs</span> are the ones with <code>CWL</code> in the name, for example <code>Write-CWLLogEvent</code>.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"lang-powershell\"># Set up some random customer ids, and select a third of them to be our unfortunates\n# who will experience random errors due to a bad api update being shipped!\n$allCustomerIds = @( 1..15 | % { Get-Random })\n$faultingIds = $allCustomerIds | Get-Random -Count 5\n\n# Setup some log groups\n$group1 = 'MyApplicationLogsV1'\n$group2 = 'MyApplicationLogsV2'\n$stream = &quot;MyApplicationLogStream&quot;\n\n# When writing to a log stream we need to specify a sequencing token\n$group1Sequence = $null\n$group2Sequence = $null\n\n$group1, $group2 | % {\n    if (!(Get-CWLLogGroup -LogGroupName $_)) {\n        New-CWLLogGroup -LogGroupName $_\n        New-CWLLogStream -LogGroupName $_ -LogStreamName $stream\n    } else {\n        # When the log group and stream exist, we need to seed the sequence token to\n        # the next expected value\n        $logstream = Get-CWLLogStream -LogGroupName $_ -LogStreamName $stream\n        $token = $logstream.UploadSequenceToken\n        if ($_ -eq $group1) {\n            $group1Sequence = $token\n        } else {\n            $group2Sequence = $token\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n# generate some log data with random failures for the subset of customers\n1..5000 | % {\n\n    Write-Host &quot;Log event iteration $_&quot; # just so we know where we are progress-wise\n\n    $customerId = Get-Random $allCustomerIds\n\n    # first select whether the user called the v1 or the v2 api\n    $useV2Api = ((Get-Random) % 2 -eq 1)\n    if ($useV2Api) {\n        $resourcePath = '/api/v2/some/resource/path/'\n        $targetLogGroup = $group2\n        $nextToken = $group2Sequence\n    } else {\n        $resourcePath = '/api/v1/some/resource/path/'\n        $targetLogGroup = $group1\n        $nextToken = $group1Sequence\n    }\n\n    # now select whether they failed or not.

DynamoDB supports some of the world’s largest scale applications by providing consistent, single-digit millisecond response times at any scale. You can build applications with virtually unlimited throughput and storage. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/\">DynamoDB global tables</a> replicate your data across multiple AWS Regions to give you fast, local access to data for your globally distributed applications. For use cases that require even faster access with microsecond latency, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax/?nc1=h_ls\">DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)</a> provides a fully managed in-memory cache.</p> \n<p>In November 2019, we announced <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/contributorinsights_HowItWorks.html\">Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights for Amazon DynamoDB</a> as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/new-amazon-cloudwatch-contributor-insights-for-amazon-dynamodb-preview-helps-you-identify-frequently-accessed-keys-and-database-traffic-trends/\">Preview</a>, and today, I am happy to announce it is Generally Available for all AWS Regions.</p> \n<h3><strong><u>Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights for Amazon DynamoDB</u></strong></h3> \n<p>Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights, which also launched <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/amazon-cloudwatch-now-includes-contributor-insights-preview/\">in November 2019</a>, analyzes log data and creates time-series visualizations to provide a view of top contributors influencing system performance. You do this by creating Contributor Insights rules to evaluate CloudWatch Logs (including logs from AWS services) and any custom logs sent by your service or on-premises servers. For example, you can find bad hosts, identify the heaviest network users, or find the URLs that generate the most errors.</p> \n<p>For developers building applications on top of DynamoDB, it’s useful to understand your database access patterns, such as traffic trends and frequently accessed keys, to help optimize DynamoDB costs and performance. You can create visualizations of these patterns with just a few clicks in the console using CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB. DynamoDB automatically creates the required CloudWatch resources, then provides a summary view of the graphs. This summary view lives in the DynamoDB console, but you can also see the individual rule details in the CloudWatch console with other&nbsp;CloudWatch Contributor Insights&nbsp;rules,&nbsp;reports, and graphs of report data.</p> \n<p>You can use these graphs to view traffic trends and pinpoint any hot keys in your DynamoDB tables.</p> \n<h3><strong><u>How it works</u></strong></h3> \n<p>Let’s see how it works and how it benefits developers.

This metric shows the frequency of which a key is accessed, based on both read and write traffic.</p> \n<p>Outliers in these graphs are your most frequently accessed, or hottest, keys. Many DynamoDB workloads have at least some imbalanced traffic, but you can use this graph to see whether your workload will bump against DynamoDB’s per-key limits. On the other hand, if you see several closely clustered lines without any obvious outliers, it indicates that your workload is relatively balanced across items over the given time window (great job balancing your workload!)</p> \n<h4><strong>Most Throttled Items</strong></h4> \n<p>The “Most Throttled Items” shows just that, a graph of throttle count over time for your most throttled keys. If you see no data in this graph, it means your requests have not been throttled. If you see isolated points instead of connected lines, that indicates an item was throttled only for a brief period.</p> \n<p>This blog article “<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/choosing-the-right-dynamodb-partition-key/\">Choosing the Right DynamoDB Partition Key</a>” tells us the importance of considerations and strategies for choosing the right partition key for designing a&nbsp;schema&nbsp;that uses Amazon DynamoDB. Choosing the right partition key is an important step in the design and building of scalable and reliable applications on top of DynamoDB. Also, you can check our DynamoDB documentation page “<a href=\"https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-partition-key-design.html\">Best Practices for Designing and Using Partition Keys Effectively</a>“.</p> \n<h3><u>Integrating with CloudWatch Dashboard</u></h3> \n<p>This feature is integrated with CloudWatch for ease of use. You can integrate any of these graphs onto an existing CloudWatch dashboard. Let’s see how to do it. Going back to the DynamoDB dashboard, click [<strong>Add to dashboard</strong>].<br /> You are redirected to CloudWatch Management Console, and are asked which dashboard to add in.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/02/20/2020-02-20-14-57-36.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-35772\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/02/20/2020-02-20-14-57-36.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"696\" height=\"302\" /></a></p> \n<p>You can choose any existing dashboard or create a new one. For example, I put these metrics into my existing test dashboard as [<strong>test20180321</strong>].</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/02/20/2020-02-20-14-58-26.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-35773\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/02/20/2020-02-20-14-58-26-1024x447.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"447\" /></a></p> \n<p>Activating the feature does not affect anything in your existing production environment.

    "content:encoded": "<p>Since we launched <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/\" title=\"\">Amazon Redshift</a> as a cloud data warehouse service <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-redshift-the-new-aws-data-warehouse/\">more than seven years ago</a>, tens of thousands of customers built their workloads using it. We are always listening to your feedback and, in December last year, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-redshift-update-next-generation-compute-instances-and-managed-analytics-optimized-storage/\">we announced</a> our 3rd generation RA3 node type providing you the ability to scale compute and storage separately. Previous generation DS2 and DC2 nodes had a fixed amount of storage and required adding more nodes to your cluster to increase storage capacity. The new RA3 nodes let you determine how much compute capacity you need to support your workload and then scale the amount of storage based on your needs. The first member of the RA3 family was the <code>ra3.16xlarge</code> which we heard from many customers was fantastic, but more than they needed for their workload needs.</p> \n<p>Today we are adding a new smaller member to the RA3 family: the <code>ra3.4xlarge</code>.</p> \n<p>The RA3 node type is based on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro</a> and includes support for <span title=\"\">Redshift</span> managed storage. <span title=\"\">Redshift</span> managed storage automatically manages data placement across tiers of storage and caches the hottest data in high-performance SSD storage while automatically offloading colder data to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" title=\"\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a>. <span title=\"\">Redshift</span> managed storage uses advanced techniques such as block temperature, data block age, and workload patterns to optimize performance.</p> \n<p>RA3 nodes with managed storage are a great fit for analytics workloads that require massive storage capacity and can be a great fit for workloads such as operational analytics, where the subset of data that is most important evolves constantly over time. In the past, there was pressure to offload or archive old data to other storage because of fixed storage limits. This made maintaining the operational analytics data set and the larger historical dataset difficult to query when needed.</p> \n<p>The new <code>ra3.4xlarge</code> node provides 12 vCPUs, 96 GiB of RAM, and addresses up to 64 Tb of managed storage. A cluster can contain up to 32 of these instances, for a total storage of 2048 TB (that’s 2 petabytes!).</p> \n<p>The differences between <code>ra3.16xlarge</code> and <code>ra3.4xlarge</code> nodes are summarized in the table below.<strong><br /> </strong></p> \n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td width=\"16%\"></td> \n   <td style=\"text-align: center\" width=\"10%\"><strong>vCPU</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"text-align: center\" width=\"16%\"><strong>Memory</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"text-align: center\" width=\"22%\"><strong>Addressable Storage </strong></td> \n   <td style=\"text-align: center\" width=\"10%\"><strong>I/O</strong></td> \n   <td style=\"text-align: center\" width=\"22%\"><strong>Price<br /> (<span title=\"\">US East (N.

    "content:encoded": "<p>Almost five years ago, I <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-receive-alerts-when-specific-apis-are-called-by-using-aws-cloudtrail-amazon-sns-and-aws-lambda/\">blogged about a solution</a> that automatically analyzes <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/\" title=\"\">AWS CloudTrail</a> data to generate alerts upon sensitive API usage. It was a simple and basic solution for security analysis and automation. But demanding AWS customers have multiple AWS accounts, collect data from multiple sources, and simple searches based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\">regular expressions</a> are not enough to conduct in-depth analysis of suspected security-related events. Today, when a security issue is detected, such as compromised credentials or unauthorized access to a resource, security analysts cross-analyze several data logs to understand the root cause of the issue and its impact on the environment. In-depth analysis often requires scripting and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\">ETL</a> to connect the dots between data generated by multiple siloed systems. It requires skilled data engineers to answer basic questions such as “is this normal?”. Analysts use Security Information and Event Management (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management\">SIEM</a>) tools, third-party libraries, and data visualization tools to validate, compare, and correlate data to reach their conclusions. To further complicate the matters, new AWS accounts and new applications are constantly introduced, forcing analysts to constantly reestablish baselines of normal behavior, and to understand new patterns of activities every time they evaluate a new security issue.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/detective\" title=\"\">Amazon Detective</a> is a fully managed service that empowers users to automate the heavy lifting involved in processing large quantities of AWS log data to determine the cause and impact of a security issue. Once enabled, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/detective\" title=\"\">Detective</a> automatically begins distilling and organizing data from <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/\" title=\"AWS Guard Duty\">AWS Guard Duty</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/\" title=\"\">AWS CloudTrail</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/\" title=\"\">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> Flow Logs into a graph model that summarizes the resource behaviors and interactions observed across your entire AWS environment.</p> \n<p>At <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/12/introducing-amazon-detective/\">re:invent 2019, we announced</a> a preview of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/detective\" title=\"\">Amazon Detective</a>. Today, it is our pleasure to announce its availability for all AWS Customers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/detective\" title=\"\">Amazon Detective</a> uses machine learning models to produce graphical representations of your account behavior and helps you to answer questions such as “is this an unusual API call for this role?” or “is this spike in traffic from this instance expected?”. You do not need to write code, to configure or to tune your own queries.</p> \n<p>To get started with <span title=\"\">Amazon Detective</span>, I open the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com\" title=\"\">AWS Management Console</a>, I type “detective” in the search bar and I select <span title=\"\">Amazon Detective</span> from the provided results to launch the service.

    "content:encoded": "<p>Last year at AWS re:Invent 2019, we <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/identify-unintended-resource-access-with-aws-identity-and-access-management-iam-access-analyzer/\">released</a> AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/analyze-access/\">Access Analyzer</a> that helps you understand who can access resources by analyzing permissions granted using policies for <a title=\"\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> buckets, <a title=\"\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">IAM</a> roles, <a title=\"\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kms/\">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a> keys, <a title=\"\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> functions, and <a title=\"\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a> queues.</p> \n<p>AWS IAM Access Analyzer uses <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/analyze-access/?nc1=h_ls#Automated_reasoning_for_policy_analysis\">automated reasoning</a>, a form of mathematical logic and inference, to determine all possible access paths allowed by a resource policy. We call these analytical results <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/\">provable security</a>, a higher level of assurance for security in the cloud.</p> \n<p>Today I am pleased to announce that you can create an analyzer in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/\">AWS Organizations</a> master account or a delegated member account with the entire organization as the zone of trust. Now for each analyzer, you can create a zone of trust to be either a particular account or an entire organization, and set the logical bounds for the analyzer to base findings upon. This helps you quickly identify when resources in your organization can be accessed from outside of your AWS Organization.</p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">AWS IAM Access Analyzer for AWS Organizations – Getting started</span></strong><br /> You can enable IAM Access Analyzer, in your organization with one click in the IAM Console. Once enabled, IAM Access Analyzer analyzes policies and reports a list of findings for resources that grant public or cross-account access from outside your AWS Organizations in the IAM console and through APIs.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/30/2020-iam-1-Creating-an-analyzer-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-36422 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/30/2020-iam-1-Creating-an-analyzer-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"839\" height=\"767\" /></a></p> \n<p>When you create an analyzer on your organization, it recognizes your organization as a zone of trust, meaning all accounts within the organization are trusted to have access to AWS resources. Access analyzer will generate a report that identifies access to your resources from outside of the organization.</p> \n<p>For example, if you create an analyzer for your organization then it provides active findings for resource such as S3 buckets in your organization that are accessible publicly or from outside the organization.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/30/2020-iam-2-List-of-findings-featured-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-36423 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/30/2020-iam-2-List-of-findings-featured-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1058\" height=\"750\" /></a></p> \n<p>When policies change, IAM Access Analyzer automatically triggers a new analysis and reports new findings based on the policy changes. You can also trigger a re-evaluation manually. You can download the details of findings into a report to support compliance audits.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/30/2020-iam-3-Finding-details-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-36424 size-full\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/30/2020-iam-3-Finding-details-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1351\" height=\"774\" /></a></p> \n<p>Analyzers are specific to the region in which they are created. You need to create a unique analyzer for each region where you want to enable IAM Access Analyzer.</p> \n<p>You can create multiple analyzers for your entire organization in your organization’s master account. Additionally, you can also choose a member account in your organization as a delegated administrator for IAM Access Analyzer. When you choose a member account as the delegated administrator, the member account has a permission to create analyzers within the organization. Additionally individual accounts can create analyzers to identify resources accessible from outside those accounts.</p> \n<p>IAM Access Analyzer sends an event to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/\">Amazon EventBridge</a> for each generated finding, for a change to the status of an existing finding, and when a finding is deleted. You can <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-eventbridge.html\">monitor IAM Access Analyzer findings</a> with EventBridge. Also, all IAM Access Analyzer <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html\">actions are logged</a> by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/\">AWS CloudTrail</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/\">AWS Security Hub</a>. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Access Analyzer, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.</p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Now available!</span></strong><br /> This integration is available in all AWS Regions where IAM Access Analyzer is available. There is no extra cost for creating an analyzer with organization as the zone of trust.

    "content:encoded": "<p>When you start an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">EC2 instance</a>, it’s easy to underestimate what an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/#Regions\">AWS Region</a> is. Right now, we have 22 across the world, and while they look like dots on a global map, they are&nbsp;architected to let you&nbsp;run applications and store data with high availability and fault tolerance. In fact, each of our Regions is made up of multiple data centers, which are geographically separated into what we call <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/#Availability_Zones\">Availability Zones (AZs)</a>.</p> \n<p>Today, I am very happy to announce that we added a third AZ to the AWS Canada (Central) Region to support our customer base in Canada.&nbsp;It’s important to notice that <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon S3</a> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-compare\">storage classes that replicate data across a minimum&nbsp;of three AZs</a>, are always doing so, even when fewer than three AZs are&nbsp;publicly available.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/17/aws_regions-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-36179\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/17/aws_regions-1-1024x520.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"520\" /></a></p> \n<p>This third AZ provides customers with additional flexibility to architect scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available applications, and will support additional AWS services in Canada.&nbsp;We <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-canada-central-region/\">opened the Canada (Central) Region in December 2016</a>, just over 3 years ago, and we’ve <strong>more than tripled</strong> the number of available services as we bring on this third AZ.</p> \n<p>Each AZ is in a separate and distinct geographic location with enough distance to significantly reduce the risk of a single event impacting availability in the Region, yet near enough for business continuity applications that require rapid failover and synchronous replication. For example, our Canada (Central) Region is located in the Montreal area of Quebec, and the upcoming new AZ will be on the mainland more than <strong>45 kms/28 miles</strong> away from the next-closest AZ as the crow flies.</p> \n<p>Where we place our Regions and AZs is a deliberate and thoughtful process that takes into account not only latency or distance, but also <strong>risk profiles</strong>. To keep the risk profile low, we look at decades of data related to floods and other environmental factors before we settle on a location. Montreal was heavily impacted in 1998 by a massive ice storm that crippled the power grid and brought down more than 1,000 transmission towers, leaving four million people in neighboring provinces and some areas of New York and Maine without power. In order to ensure that AWS infrastructure can withstand inclement weather such as this, half of the AZs interconnections use <strong>underground&nbsp;cables</strong> and are out of the impact of potential ice storms. In this way,&nbsp;every AZ is connected to the other two AZs by at least one 100% underground fiber path.</p> \n<p>We’re excited to bring a new AZ to Canada to serve our incredible customers in the region. Here are some examples from different industries, courtesy of my colleagues in Canada:</p> \n<p><strong>Healthcare</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alayacare.com\">AlayaCare</a>&nbsp;delivers cloud-based software to home care organizations across Canada and all over the world.&nbsp;As a home healthcare technology company, they need in-country data centers to meet regulatory requirements.</p> \n<p><strong>Insurance</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aviva.ca/\">Aviva</a> is&nbsp;delivering a world-class digital experience to its insurance clients in Canada and&nbsp;the expansion of the AWS Region is welcome as they continue to move more of their applications to the cloud.</p> \n<p><strong>E-Learning</strong> – <a href=\"https://www.d2l.com\">D2L</a> leverages various AWS Regions around the world, including Canada to deliver a seamless experience for their clients. They have been&nbsp;on AWS for more than four years, and recently completed an all-in migration.</p> \n<p>With this launch, AWS has now 70 AZs within 22 geographic Regions around the world, plus 5 new regions coming. We are continuously looking at expanding our infrastructure footprint globally, driven largely by customer demand.</p> \n<p>To see how we use AZs in Amazon, have look at this article on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/\">Static stability using Availability Zones</a>&nbsp;by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/authors/becky-weiss/\">Becky Weiss</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/authors/mike-furr/\">Mike Furr</a>.

En fait, chacune de nos r&eacute;gions comprend plusieurs centres de donn&eacute;es distincts, regroup&eacute;s dans ce que nous appelons des <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/#Availability_Zones\">zones de disponibilit&eacute;s</a>.</p> \n<p>Aujourd’hui, je suis tr&egrave;s heureux d’annoncer que nous avons ajout&eacute; une troisi&egrave;me zone de disponibilit&eacute; &agrave; la R&eacute;gion AWS Canada (Centre) afin de r&eacute;pondre &agrave; la demande croissante de nos clients canadiens.&nbsp;Il est important de noter que que les classes de stockage <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon S3</a> qui <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-compare\">r&eacute;pliquent des donn&eacute;es &agrave; travers au moins trois zones de disponibilit&eacute;</a>, le font toujours, m&ecirc;me lorsque moins de trois zones de disponibilit&eacute; sont accessibles publiquement.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/17/aws_regions-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-36179\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/17/aws_regions-1-1024x520.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"520\" /></a></p> \n<p>Cette troisi&egrave;me zone de disponibilit&eacute; offre aux clients une souplesse additionnelle, leur permettant de concevoir des applications &eacute;volutives, tol&eacute;rantes et hautement disponibles. Cette zone de disponibilit&eacute; permettra &eacute;galement la prise en charge d’un plus grand nombre de services AWS au Canada. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-canada-central-region/\">Nous avons ouvert la r&eacute;gion infonuagique en d&eacute;cembre 2016</a>, il y a un peu plus de trois ans, et nous avons <strong>plus que tripl&eacute;</strong> le nombre de services disponibles en lan&ccedil;ant cette troisi&egrave;me zone.</p> \n<p>Chaque zone de disponibilit&eacute; AWS se situe dans un lieu g&eacute;ographique s&eacute;par&eacute; et distinct, suffisamment &eacute;loign&eacute;e pour r&eacute;duire le risque qu’un seul &eacute;v&eacute;nement puisse avoir une incidence sur la disponibilit&eacute; dans la r&eacute;gion, mais assez rapproch&eacute; pour permettre le bon fonctionnement d’applications de continuit&eacute; d’activit&eacute;s qui n&eacute;cessitent un basculement rapide et une r&eacute;plication synchrone. Par exemple, notre R&eacute;gion Canada (Centre) se situe dans la r&eacute;gion du grand Montr&eacute;al, au Qu&eacute;bec.&nbsp;La nouvelle zone de disponibilit&eacute; sera situ&eacute;e &agrave; <strong>plus de 45 km</strong> &agrave; vol d’oiseau de la zone de disponibilit&eacute; la plus proche.</p> \n<p>D&eacute;finir l’emplacement de nos r&eacute;gions et de nos zones de disponibilit&eacute; est un processus d&eacute;lib&eacute;r&eacute; et r&eacute;fl&eacute;chi, qui tient compte non seulement de la latence/distance, mais aussi des <strong>profils de risque</strong>. Par exemple, nous examinons les donn&eacute;es li&eacute;es aux inondations et &agrave; d’autres facteurs environnementaux sur des d&eacute;cennies avant de nous installer &agrave; un endroit. Ceci nous permet de maintenir un profil de risque faible. En 1998, Montr&eacute;al a &eacute;t&eacute; lourdement touch&eacute;e par la temp&ecirc;te du verglas, qui a non seulement paralys&eacute; le r&eacute;seau &eacute;lectrique et engendr&eacute; l’effondrement de plus de 1 000 pyl&ocirc;nes de transmission, mais qui a &eacute;galement laiss&eacute; quatre millions de personnes sans &eacute;lectricit&eacute; dans les provinces avoisinantes et certaines parties dans les &eacute;tats de New York et du Maine. Afin de s’assurer que l’infrastructure AWS r&eacute;siste &agrave; de telles intemp&eacute;ries, la moiti&eacute; des interconnexions c&acirc;bl&eacute;es des zones de disponibilit&eacute; d’AWS sont <strong>souterraines</strong>, &agrave; l’abri des temp&ecirc;tes de verglas potentielles par exemple. Ainsi, chaque zone de disponibilit&eacute; est reli&eacute;e aux deux autres zones par au moins un r&eacute;seau de fibre enti&egrave;rement souterrain.</p> \n<p>Nous nous r&eacute;jouissons d’offrir &agrave; nos clients canadiens une nouvelle zone de disponibilit&eacute; pour la r&eacute;gion. Voici quelques exemples clients de diff&eacute;rents secteurs,&nbsp;gracieuset&eacute; de mes coll&egrave;gues canadiens&nbsp;:</p> \n<p><strong>Sant&eacute;</strong> – <a href=\"https://www.alayacare.com/\">AlayaCare</a> fournit des logiciels de sant&eacute; &agrave; domicile bas&eacute;s sur le nuage &agrave; des organismes de soins &agrave; domicile canadiens et partout dans le monde. Pour une entreprise de technologie de soins &agrave; domicile, le fait d’avoir des centres de donn&eacute;es au pays est essentiel et lui permet de r&eacute;pondre aux exigences r&eacute;glementaires.</p> \n<p><strong>Assurance</strong> – <a href=\"https://www.aviva.ca/\">Aviva</a> offre une exp&eacute;rience num&eacute;rique de classe mondiale &agrave; ses clients du secteur de l’assurance au Canada. L’expansion de la r&eacute;gion AWS est bien accueillie alors qu’ils poursuivent la migration d’un nombre croissant de leurs applications vers l’infonuagique.</p> \n<p><strong>Apprentissage en ligne</strong> – <a href=\"https://www.d2l.com/\">D2L</a> s’appuie sur diverses r&eacute;gions dans le monde, dont celle au Canada, pour offrir une exp&eacute;rience homog&egrave;ne &agrave; ses clients. Ils sont sur AWS depuis plus de quatre ans et ont r&eacute;cemment effectu&eacute; une migration compl&egrave;te.</p> \n<p>Avec ce lancement, AWS compte d&eacute;sormais 70 zones de disponibilit&eacute; dans 22 r&eacute;gions g&eacute;ographiques au monde – et cinq nouvelles r&eacute;gions &agrave; venir. Nous sommes continuellement &agrave; la recherche de moyens pour &eacute;tendre notre infrastructure &agrave; l’&eacute;chelle mondiale, entre autres en raison de la demande croissante des clients.</p> \n<p>Pour comprendre comment nous utilisons les zones de disponibilit&eacute; chez Amazon, consultez <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/\">cet article sur la stabilit&eacute; statique &agrave; l’aide des zones de disponibilit&eacute;</a> par <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/authors/becky-weiss/\">Becky Weiss</a> et <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/authors/mike-furr/\">Mike Furr</a>.

While the existing SSD (Solid State Drive) storage option is designed for the highest performance latency-sensitive workloads like databases, media processing, and analytics, HDD storage is designed for a broad spectrum of workloads including home directories, departmental shares, and content management systems.</p> \n<p>Single-AZ HDD storage is priced at $0.013 per GB-month and Multi-AZ HDD storage is priced at $0.025 per GB-month (this makes <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/\" title=\"\">Amazon FSx for Windows File Server</a> the lowest cost file storage for Windows applications and workloads in the cloud). Even better, if you use this option in conjunction with Data Deduplication and use 50% space savings as a reasonable reference point, you can achieve an effective cost of $0.0065 per GB-month for a single-AZ file system and $0.0125 per GB-month for a multi-AZ file system.</p> \n<p>You can choose the HDD option when you create a new file system:</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/fsx_win_create_multi_az_2.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"458\" /></p> \n<p>If you have existing SSD-based file systems, you can create new HDD-based file systems and then use AWS <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/migrate-files-to-fsx-datasync.html\">DataSync</a> or <code>robocopy</code> to move the files. Backups taken from newly created SSD or HDD file systems can be restored to either type of storage, and with any desired level of throughput capacity.</p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong>Performance and Caching</strong></span><br /> The HDD storage option is designed to deliver 12 MB/second of throughput per TiB of storage, with the ability to handle bursts of up to 80 MB/second per TiB of storage. When you create your file system, you also specify the throughput capacity:</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/fsx_pick_throughput_1.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"478\" /></p> \n<p>The amount of throughput that you provision also controls the size of a fast, in-memory cache for your file share; higher levels of throughput come with larger amounts of cache. As a result, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/\" title=\"\">Amazon FSx for Windows File Server</a> file systems can be provisioned so as to be able to provide over 3 GB/s of network throughput and hundreds of thousands of network IOPS, even with HDD storage. This will allow you to create cost-effective file systems that are able to handle many different use cases, including those where a modest subset of a large amount of data is accessed frequently.

    "content:encoded": "<p>In-memory data stores are widely used for application scalability, and developers have long appreciated their benefits for storing frequently accessed data, whether volatile or persistent. Systems like <a href=\"https://redis.io/\">Redis</a> help decouple databases and backends from incoming traffic, shedding most of the traffic that would had otherwise reached them, and reducing application latency for users.</p> \n<p>Obviously, managing these servers is a critical task, and great care must be taken to keep them up and running no matter what. In a previous job, my team had to move a cluster of physical cache servers across hosting suites: one by one, they connected them to external batteries, unplugged external power, unracked them, and used an office trolley (!) to roll them to the other suite where they racked them again! It happened without any service interruption, but we all breathed a sigh of relief once this was done… Lose cache data on a high-traffic platform, and things get ugly. Fast. Fortunately, cloud infrastructure is more flexible! To help minimize service disruption should an incident occur, we have added many <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/configuring-amazon-elasticache-for-redis-for-higher-availability/\">high-availability features</a> to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/\" title=\"\">Amazon ElastiCache</a>, our managed in-memory data store for <a href=\"https://memcached.org/\">Memcached</a> and <a href=\"https://redis.io/\">Redis</a>: cluster mode, multi-AZ with automatic failover, etc.</p> \n<p>As Redis is often used to serve low latency traffic to global users, customers have told us that they’d love to be able to replicate <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/\" title=\"\">Amazon ElastiCache</a> clusters across AWS regions. We listened to them, got to work, and today, we’re very happy to announce that this replication capability is now available for Redis clusters.</p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong>Introducing Amazon ElastiCache Global Datastore For Redis<br /> </strong></span>In a nutshell, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/global-datastore/\">Amazon ElastiCache Global Datastore for Redis</a> lets you replicate a cluster in one region to clusters in up to two other regions. Customers typically do this in order to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Bring cached data closer to your users, in order to reduce network latency and improve application responsiveness.</li> \n <li>Build disaster recovery capabilities, should a region be partially or totally unavailable.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Setting up a global datastore is extremely easy. First, you pick a cluster to be the primary cluster receiving writes from applications: this can either be a new cluster, or an existing cluster provided that it runs Redis 5.0.6 or above. Then, you add up to two secondary clusters in other regions which will receive updates from the primary.</p> \n<p>This setup is available for all Redis configurations except single node clusters: of course, you can convert a single node cluster to a replication group cluster, and then use it as a primary cluster.</p> \n<p>Last but not least, clusters that are part of a global datastore can be modified and resized as usual (adding or removing nodes, changing node type, adding or removing shards, adding or removing replica nodes).</p> \n<p>Let’s do a quick demo.</p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Replicating a Redis Cluster Across Regions<br /> </span></strong>Let me show you how to build from scratch a three-cluster global datastore: the primary cluster will be located in the us-east-1 region, and the two secondary clusters will be located in the us-west-1 and us-west-2 regions. For the sake of simplicity, I’ll use the same default configuration for all clusters: three cache.r5.large nodes, multi-AZ, one shard.</p> \n<p>Heading out to the AWS Console, I click on ‘Global Datastore’, and then on ‘Create’ to create my global datastore. I’m asked if I’d like to create a new cluster supporting the datastore, or if I’d rather use an existing cluster. I go for the former, and create a cluster named <em>global-ds-1-useast1</em>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/05/julsimon-globalds1-1.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-35984 aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/05/julsimon-globalds1-1-880x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"880\" height=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<p>I click on ‘Next’, and fill in details for a secondary cluster hosted in the us-west-1 region.

Using an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\" title=\"\">EC2</a> instance hosted in the us-west-1 region, let’s now check that the data we stored in the primary cluster has been replicated to the us-west-1 secondary cluster.</p> \n<p><code>[us-west-1-instance] $ redis-cli -h $US_WEST_1_CLUSTER_READONLY</code><br /> <code>&gt; keys *</code><br /> <code>1) &quot;london&quot;</code><br /> <code>2) &quot;berlin&quot;</code><br /> <code>3) &quot;paris&quot;</code><br /> <code>&gt; get paris</code><br /> <code>&quot;france&quot;</code></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Nice. Now let’s add some more data on the primary cluster…</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><code>&gt; hset Parsifal composer &quot;Richard Wagner&quot; date 1882 acts 3 language &quot;German&quot;</code><br /> <code>&gt; hset DonGiovanni composer &quot;W.A. Mozart&quot; date 1787 acts 2 language &quot;Italian&quot;</code><br /> <code>&gt; hset Tosca composer &quot;Giacomo Puccini&quot; date 1900 acts 3 language &quot;Italian&quot;</code></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left\">…and check as quickly as possible on the secondary cluster.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><code>&gt; keys *</code><br /> <code>1) &quot;DonGiovanni&quot;</code><br /> <code>2) &quot;london&quot;</code><br /> <code>3) &quot;berlin&quot;</code><br /> <code>4) &quot;Parsifal&quot;</code><br /> <code>5) &quot;Tosca&quot;</code><br /> <code>6) &quot;paris&quot;</code><br /> <code>&gt; hget Parsifal composer</code><br /> <code>&quot;Richard Wagner&quot;</code></p> \n<p>That was fast: by the time I switched to the other terminal and ran the command, the new data was already there. That’s not really surprising since the typical network latency for cross region traffic ranges from 60 milliseconds to 200 milliseconds depending on regions.</p> \n<p>Now, what would happen if something went wrong with our primary cluster hosted in us-east-1? Well, we could easily promote one of the secondary clusters to full read/write capabilities.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/11/04/globalds4.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-32023 aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/11/04/globalds4-1024x471.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"471\" /></a></p> \n<p>For good measure, I also remove the us-east-1 cluster from the global datastore. Once this is complete, the global datastore looks like this.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/02/03/julsimon-globalds4.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-35574 aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/02/03/julsimon-globalds4-1024x463.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"463\" /></a></p> \n<p>Now, using my <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\" title=\"\">EC2</a> instance in the us-west-1 region, and connecting to the read/write endpoint of my cluster, I add more data…</p> \n<p><code>[us-west-1-instance] $ redis-cli -h $US_WEST_1_CLUSTER_READWRITE</code><br /> <code>&gt; hset Lohengrin composer &quot;Richard Wagner&quot; date 1850 acts 3 language &quot;German&quot;</code></p> \n<p>… and check that it’s been replicated to the us-west-2 cluster.</p> \n<p><code>[us-west-2-instance] $ redis-cli -h $US_WEST_2_CLUSTER_READONLY<br /> </code><code></code><code>&gt; hgetall Lohengrin</code><br /> <code>1) &quot;composer&quot;</code><br /> <code>2) &quot;Richard Wagner&quot;</code><br /> <code>3) &quot;date&quot;</code><br /> <code>4) &quot;1850&quot;</code><br /> <code>5) &quot;acts&quot;</code><br /> <code>6) &quot;3&quot;</code><br /> <code>7) &quot;language&quot;</code><br /> <code>8) &quot;German&quot;</code></p> \n<p>It’s all there.

    "content:encoded": "<p>At AWS, we take pride in building state of the art virtualization technologies to simplify the management and access to cloud services such as networks, computing resources or object storage.</p> \n<p>In a Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), a view is virtualization applied to tables : it is a virtual table representing the result of a database query. Views are frequently used when designing a schema, to present a subset of the data, summarized data (such as aggregated or transformed data) or to simplify data access across multiple tables. When using data warehouses, such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/\" title=\"\">Amazon Redshift</a>, a view simplifies access to aggregated data from multiple tables for Business Intelligence (BI) tools such as <a href=\"https://quicksight.aws\" title=\"\">Amazon QuickSight</a> or <a href=\"https://www.tableau.com/\">Tableau</a>.</p> \n<p>Views provide ease of use and flexibility but they are not speeding up data access. The database system must evaluate the underlying query representing the view each time your application accesses the view. When performance is key, data engineers use <code>create table as</code> (CTAS) as an alternative. A CTAS is a table defined by a query. The query is executed at table creation time and your applications can use it like a normal table, with the downside that the CTAS data set is not refreshed when underlying data are updated. Furthermore, the CTAS definition is not stored in the database system. It is not possible to know if a table was created by a CTAS or not, making it difficult to track which CTAS needs to be refreshed and which is current.</p> \n<p>Today, we are introducing <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/materialized-view-overview.html\">materialized views</a> for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/\" title=\"\">Amazon Redshift</a>. A materialized view (MV) is a database object containing the data of a query. A materialized view is like a cache for your view. Instead of building and computing the data set at run-time, the materialized view pre-computes, stores and optimizes data access at the time you create it. Data are ready and available to your queries just like regular table data.</p> \n<p>Using materialized views in your analytics queries can speed up the query execution time by orders of magnitude because the query defining the materialized view is already executed and the data is already available to the database system.</p> \n<p>Materialized views are especially useful for queries that are predictable and repeated over and over. Instead of performing resource-intensive queries on large tables, applications can query the pre-computed data stored in the materialized view.</p> \n<p>When the data in the base tables are changing, you refresh the materialized view by issuing a <span title=\"\">Redshift</span> SQL statement “<code>refresh materialized view</code>“. After issuing a refresh statement, your materialized view contains the same data as would have been returned by a regular view. Refreshes can be incremental or full refreshes (recompute). When possible, <span title=\"\">Redshift</span> incrementally refreshes data that changed in the base tables since the materialized view was last refreshed.</p> \n<p>Let’s see how it works. I create a sample schema to store sales information : each sales transaction and details about the store where the sales took place.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/13/2020-03-13_08-22-01.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36124 size-medium\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/13/2020-03-13_08-22-01-300x158.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" /></a></p> \n<p>To view the total amount of sales per city, I create a materialized view with the <code>create materialized view</code> SQL statement. I connect to the <span title=\"\">Redshift</span> console, select the query <strong>Editor</strong> and type the following statement to create a materialized view (<code>city_sales</code>) joining records from two tables and aggregating sales amount (<code>sum(sales.amount)</code>) per city (<code>group by city</code>):</p> \n<pre><code class=\"lang-sql\">CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW city_sales AS (\n  SELECT st.city, SUM(sa.amount) as total_sales\n  FROM sales sa, store st\n  WHERE sa.store_id = st.id\n  GROUP BY st.city\n);</code></pre> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/13/2020-03-13_08-55-06.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36126\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/13/2020-03-13_08-55-06.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1772\" height=\"984\" /></a></p> \n<p>The resulting schema is below:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/13/2020-03-13_08-43-15.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36125 size-medium\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/13/2020-03-13_08-43-15-300x255.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"255\" /></a>Now I can query the materialized view just like a regular view or table and issue statements like “<code>SELECT city, total_sales FROM city_sales</code>” to get the below results. The join between the two tables and the aggregate (<code>sum</code> and <code>group by</code>) are already computed, resulting to significantly less data to scan.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/13/2020-03-13_08-57-56.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36127\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/13/2020-03-13_08-57-56.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1586\" height=\"786\" /></a></p> \n<p>When the data in the underlying base tables change, the materialized view is not automatically reflecting those changes. The data stored in the materialized can be refreshed on demand with latest changes from base tables using the SQL <code>refresh</code><code>materialized view</code> command. Let’s see a practical example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"lang-sql\">!-- let's add a row in the sales base table\nINSERT INTO sales (id, item, store_id, customer_id, amount)\nVALUES(8, 'Gaming PC Super ProXXL', 1, 1, 3000);\n\nSELECT city, total_sales FROM city_sales WHERE city = 'Paris'\n\ncity |total_sales|\n-----|-----------|\nParis|        690|\n\n!-- the new sale is not taken into account !\n\n!-- let's refresh the materialized view\nREFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW city_sales;\n\nSELECT city, total_sales FROM city_sales WHERE city = 'Paris'\n\ncity |total_sales|\n-----|-----------|\nParis|       3690|\n\n!-- now the view has the latest sales data\n</code></pre> \n<p>The full code for this very simple demo <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sebsto/2ce59d80a3b5d30bb1ee456e96bf0fb0\">is available as a gist</a>.</p> \n<p>You can <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/materialized-view-overview.html\">start to use materialized views</a> today in all AWS Regions.</p> \n<p>There is nothing to change in your existing clusters to start to use materialized views, you can start to create them today at no additional cost.</p> \n<p>Happy building !</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?a=gYYQyS5L-FQ:YE4ci1DmTw8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?a=gYYQyS5L-FQ:YE4ci1DmTw8:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?a=gYYQyS5L-FQ:YE4ci1DmTw8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AmazonWebServicesBlog/~4/gYYQyS5L-FQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Our customers are making great use of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/\" title=\"\">Amazon ECS</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\" title=\"\">Amazon EKS</a>, with over 80% of all cloud-based containers running on AWS.</p> \n<p>Container-based environments lend themselves to easy scale-out, and customers can run host environments that encompass hundreds or thousands of instances. At this scale, several challenges arise with the host operating system. For example:</p> \n<p><strong>Security </strong>– Installing extra packages simply to satisfy dependencies can increase the attack surface.</p> \n<p><strong>Updates</strong> – Traditional package-based update systems and mechanisms are complex and error prone, and can have issues with dependencies.</p> \n<p><strong>Overhead</strong> – Extra, unnecessary packages consume disk space and compute cycles, and also increase startup time.</p> \n<p><strong>Drift</strong> – Inconsistent packages and configurations can damage the integrity of a cluster over time.</p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Introducing <span title=\"\">Bottlerocket</span></strong></span><br /> Today I would like to tell you about <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket\" title=\"\">Bottlerocket</a>, a new Linux-based open source operating system that we designed and optimized specifically for use as a container host.</p> \n<p><span title=\"\">Bottlerocket</span> reflects much of what we have learned over the years. It includes only the packages that are needed to make it a great container host, and integrates with existing container orchestrators. It supports Docker image and images that conform to the <a href=\"https://www.opencontainers.org/\">Open Container Initiative</a> (OCI) image format.</p> \n<p>Instead of a package update system, <span title=\"\">Bottlerocket</span> uses a simple, image-based model that allows for a rapid &amp; complete rollback if necessary. This removes opportunities for conflicts and breakage, and makes it easier for you to apply fleet-wide updates with confidence using orchestrators such as EKS.</p> \n<p>In addition to the minimal package set, <span title=\"\">Bottlerocket</span> uses a file system that is primarily read-only, and that is integrity-checked at boot time via <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html\"><code>dm-verity</code></a>. SSH access is discouraged, and is available only as part of a separate <strong>admin</strong> container that you can enable on an as-needed basis and then use for troubleshooting purposes.</p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Try it Out</strong></span><br /> We’re launching a public preview of <span title=\"\">Bottlerocket</span> today. You can follow the steps in <a href=\"https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/QUICKSTART.md\">QUICKSTART</a> to set up an EKS cluster, and you can take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket\">GitHub repo</a>.

In my opinion, they provide one of the fastest ways to get a new web application from idea to prototype on AWS. So what are they? <a href=\"https://aws-amplify.github.io/\" title=\"AWS Amplify\">AWS Amplify</a> is an opinionated framework for building modern applications, with a toolchain for easily adding services like authentication (via <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\" title=\"\">Amazon Cognito</a>) or storage (via <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" title=\"\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a>) or GraphQL APIs, all via a command-line interface. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/\" title=\"AWS Amplify Console\">AWS Amplify Console</a> makes continuous deployment and hosting for your modern web apps easy. It supports hosting the frontend and backend assets for single page app (SPA) frameworks including React, Angular, Vue.js, Ionic, and Ember. It also supports static site generators like Gatsby, Eleventy, Hugo, VuePress, and Jekyll.</p> \n<p>With today’s launch, hosting options available from the <span title=\"\">AWS Amplify</span> CLI now include <span title=\"\">Amplify Console</span> in addition to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" title=\"\">S3</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\" title=\"\">Amazon CloudFront</a>. By using <span title=\"\">Amplify Console</span>, you can take advantage of features like continuous deployment, <a href=\"http://(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/ttl.html\">instant cache invalidation</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/redirects.html\">custom redirects</a>, and simple configuration of <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html\">custom domains</a>.</p> \n<h2>Initializing an Amplify App</h2> \n<p>Let’s take a look at a quick example. We’ll be deploying a static site demo of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/\" title=\"\">Amazon Transcribe</a>. I’ve already got the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\" title=\"\">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a> installed, as well as the <a href=\"https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/\"></a><a href=\"https://aws-amplify.github.io/\" title=\"AWS Amplify\">AWS Amplify</a> CLI. I’ve forked and then cloned <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-transcribe-websocket-static/\">the sample code</a> to my local machine. In the following gif, you can see the initialization process for an <span title=\"\">AWS Amplify</span> app. (I sped things up a little for the gif. It might take a few seconds for your app to be created.)</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/2019-09-06_09-48-32-1.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-30778 aligncenter\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/2019-09-06_09-48-32-1.gif\" alt=\"Terminal session showing the &quot;amplify init&quot; workflow\" width=\"656\" height=\"452\" /></a></p> \n<p>Now that I’ve got my app initialized, I can add additional services. Let’s add some hosting via <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/\" title=\"AWS Amplify Console\">AWS Amplify Console</a>. After choosing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/\" title=\"Amplify Console\">Amplify Console</a> for hosting, I can pick manual deployment or continuous deployment using a git-based workflow.</p> \n<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2> \n<p>First, I’m going to set up continuous deployment so that changes to our git repo will trigger a build and deploy.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/2019-09-06_12-07-22.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-30781 aligncenter\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/2019-09-06_12-07-22.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of a terminal session adding Amplify Console to an Amplify project\" width=\"656\" height=\"452\" /></a></p> \n<p>The workflow for configuring continuous deployment requires a quick browser session. First, I select our git provider. The forked repo is on GitHub, so I need to authorize <span title=\"\">Amplify Console</span> to use my GitHub account.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/git-provider.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-30786 aligncenter\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/git-provider.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of git provider selection\" width=\"899\" height=\"504\" /></a></p> \n<p>Once a provider is authorized, I choose the repo and branch to watch for changes.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/repo-branch.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-30785 aligncenter\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/repo-branch.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of repo and branch selection\" width=\"741\" height=\"388\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/\" title=\"AWS Amplify Console\">AWS Amplify Console</a> auto-detected the correct build settings, based on the contents of <code>package.json</code>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/app-build-settings.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-30784 aligncenter\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/app-build-settings.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of build settings\" width=\"740\" height=\"826\" /></a></p> \n<p>Once I’ve confirmed the settings, the initial build and deploy will start. Then any changes to the selected git branch will result in additional builds and deploys. Now I need to finish the workflow in the CLI, and I the need the ARN of the new <span title=\"\">Amplify Console</span> app for that. In the browser, under App Settings and then General, I copy the ARN and then paste it into my terminal, and check the status.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/status.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-30791 aligncenter\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/status.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of a terminal window where the app ARN is being set\" width=\"655\" height=\"452\" /></a></p> \n<p>A quick check of the URL in my browser confirms that the app has been successfully deployed.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/screenshot-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-30800 size-full\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/06/screenshot-2.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the sample app we deployed in this post\" width=\"1215\" height=\"704\" /></a></p> \n<h2>Manual Deploys</h2> \n<p>Manual deploys with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/\" title=\"Amplify Console\">Amplify Console</a> also provide a bunch of useful features. The CLI can now manage front-end environments, making it easy to add a test or dev environment. It’s also easy to add URL redirects and rewrites, or add a username/password via HTTP Basic Auth.</p> \n<p>Configuring manual deploys is straightforward. Just set your environment name. When it’s time to deploy, run <code>amplify publish</code>and the build scripts defined during the initialization of the project will be run. The generated artifact will then be uploaded automatically.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/11/manual-deploy.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30854\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/09/11/manual-deploy.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of a terminal window where manual deploys are configured\" width=\"654\" height=\"452\" /></a></p> \n<p>With manual deployments, you can set up multiple frontend environments (e.g. dev and prod) directly from the CLI. To create a new dev environment, run <code>amplify env add</code> (name it dev) and <code>amplify publish</code>. This will create a second frontend environment in Amplify Console. To view all your frontend and backend environments, run <code>amplify console</code> from the CLI to open your Amplify Console app.</p> \n<p>Ever since using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/\" title=\"AWS Amplify Console\">AWS Amplify Console</a> for the first time a few weeks ago, it has become my go-to way to deploy applications, especially static sites. I’m excited to see the simplicity of hosting with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/\" title=\"AWS Amplify Console\">AWS Amplify Console</a> extended to the Amplify CLI, and I hope you are too. Happy building!</p> \n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bwest\" title=\"Brandon on Twitter\">— Brandon</a><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?a=1M7qJG8XVug:lV7aK2xH6e0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?a=1M7qJG8XVug:lV7aK2xH6e0:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?a=1M7qJG8XVug:lV7aK2xH6e0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmazonWebServicesBlog?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AmazonWebServicesBlog/~4/1M7qJG8XVug\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

    "content:encoded": "<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-transcribe-scalable-and-accurate-automatic-speech-recognition/\">Launched</a> at AWS re:Invent 2017, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/\" title=\"\">Amazon Transcribe</a> is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) service that makes it easy for AWS <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/customers\">customers</a> to add speech-to-text capabilities to their applications. At the time of writing, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/\" title=\"Amazon Transcribe\">Transcribe</a> supports&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/what-is-transcribe.html\">31 languages</a><strong>,</strong> 6 of which can be transcribed in real-time.</p> \n<p>A popular use case for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/\" title=\"Amazon Transcribe\">Transcribe</a> is the automatic transcription of customer calls (call centers, telemarketing, etc.), in order to build data sets for downstream analytics and natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis. Thus, any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) should be removed to protect privacy, and comply with local laws and regulations.</p> \n<p>As you can imagine, doing this manually is quite tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone, which is why we’re extremely happy to announce that <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/\" title=\"\">Amazon Transcribe</a> now supports automatic redaction of PII.</p> \n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Introducing Content Redaction in Amazon Transcribe<br /> </strong></span>If instructed to do so, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/\" title=\"Amazon Transcribe\">Transcribe</a> will automatically identify the following pieces of PII:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Social Security Number,</li> \n <li>Credit card/Debit card number,</li> \n <li>Credit card/Debit card expiration date,</li> \n <li>Credit card/Debit card CVV code,</li> \n <li>Bank account number,</li> \n <li>Bank routing number,</li> \n <li>Debit/Credit card PIN,</li> \n <li>Name,</li> \n <li>Email address,</li> \n <li>Phone number (10 digits),</li> \n <li>Mailing address.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>They will be replaced with a ‘[PII]’ tag in the transcribed text. You also get a redaction confidence score (instead of the usual ASR score), as well as start and end timestamps. These timestamps will help you locate PII in your audio files for secure storage and sharing, or for additional audio processing to redact it at the source.</p> \n<p>This feature is extremely easy to use, let’s do a quick demo.</p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Redacting Personal Information with Amazon Transcribe<br /> </span></strong>First, I’ve recorded a short sound file full of personal information (of course, it’s all fake). I’m using the mp3 format here, but we recommend that you use lossless formats like FLAC or WAV for maximum accuracy.</p> \n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-33139-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\">\n <source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/11/19/julien.mp3?_=2\"></source>\n</audio> \n<p>Then, I upload this file to an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" title=\"\">S3</a> bucket using the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS CLI</a>.</p> \n<p><code>$ aws s3 cp julien.mp3 s3://jsimon-transcribe-us-east-1</code></p> \n<p>The next step is to transcribe this sound file using the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/transcribe/start-transcription-job.html\"><code>StartTranscriptionJob</code></a> API: why not use the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/\">AWS SDK for PHP</a> this time?</p> \n<pre><code class=\"lang-php\">&lt;?php\nrequire 'aws.phar';\n\nuse Aws\\TranscribeService\\TranscribeServiceClient;\n\n$client = new TranscribeServiceClient([\n    'profile' =&gt; 'default',\n    'region' =&gt; 'us-east-1',\n    'version' =&gt; '2017-10-26'\n]);\n\n$result = $client-&gt;startTranscriptionJob([\n    'LanguageCode' =&gt; 'en-US',\n    'Media' =&gt; [\n        'MediaFileUri' =&gt; 's3://jsimon-transcribe-us-east-1/julien.mp3',\n    ],\n    'MediaFormat' =&gt; 'mp3',\n    'OutputBucketName' =&gt; 'jsimon-transcribe-us-east-1',\n    'ContentRedaction' =&gt; [\n        'RedactionType' =&gt; 'PII',\n        'RedactionOutput' =&gt; 'redacted'\n    ],\n    'TranscriptionJobName' =&gt; 'redaction'\n]);\n?&gt;</code></pre> \n<p>A single API call is really all it takes. The <code>RedactionOutput</code> parameter lets me control whether I want both the full and the redacted output, or just the redacted output. I go for the latter. Now, let’s run this script.</p> \n<p><code>$ php transcribe.php</code></p> \n<p>Immediately, I can see the job running in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/\" title=\"Amazon Transcribe\">Transcribe</a> console.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/11/19/transcribe1.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-33147 aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2019/11/19/transcribe1-1024x275.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"275\" /></a></p> \n<p>I could also use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/API_GetTranscriptionJob\">GetTranscriptionJob</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/API_ListTranscriptionJobs\">ListTranscriptionJobs</a> APIs to check that content redaction has been applied. Once the job is complete, I simply fetch the transcription from my <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" title=\"\">S3</a> bucket.</p> \n<p><code>$ aws s3 cp s3://jsimon-transcribe-us-east-1/redacted-redactiontest.json .</code></p> \n<p>The transcription is a JSON document containing detailed information about each word. Here, I’m only interested in the full transcript, so I use a nice open source tool called <a href=\"https://stedolan.github.io/jq/\">jq</a> to filter the document.</p> \n<p><code>$ cat redacted-redactiontest.json| jq '.results.transcripts'</code><br /> <code>[</code><code>{</code><br /> <code>&quot;transcript&quot;: &quot;Good morning, everybody.

We’re now expanding beyond short-term processing by launching persistent file systems, designed for longer-term storage and workloads, where data is replicated and file servers are replaced if they fail.</p> \n<p>In addition to this new deployment option, we are also launching a second-generation scratch file system that is designed to provide better support for spiky workloads, with the ability to provide burst throughput up to 6x higher than the baseline. Like the first-generation scratch file system, this one is great for temporary storage and short-term data processing.</p> \n<p>Here is a table that will help you to chose between the deployment options:</p> \n<table style=\"border: 2px solid black;border-collapse: collapse;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto\" cellpadding=\"4\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid

You can use the latest <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/\">Amazon Linux AMI</a>, or you can create your own.</p> \n<p><strong>S3 Export</strong> – Both options allow you to export changes to S3 using the <code>CreateDataRepositoryTask</code> function. This allows you to meet stringent Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) while taking advantage of the fact that S3 is designed to deliver eleven 9’s of durability.</p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Available Now</span></strong><br /> Persistent file systems are available in all AWS regions where Amazon FSx for Lustre is available.
